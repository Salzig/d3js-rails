# d3js-rails

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

## Installation

Add the following to your gemfile:

  gem 'd3js-rails'

And then execute:

  $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

  $ gem install d3js-rails

Add the following directive to your Javascript manifest file (application.js):

  //= require d3.v2

## Versioning

d3js-rails 2.10.3 == d3.v2.js 2.10.3

Every attempt is made to mirror the currently shipping d2.v2.js version number wherever possible. The major, minor, and patch version numbers will always represent the D3.js version. Should a gem bug be discovered, a 4th version identifier will be added and incremented.
