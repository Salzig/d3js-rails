# d3js-rails

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

## Installation

Add the following to your gemfile:

  gem 'd3js-rails'

And then execute:

  $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

  $ gem install d3js-rails

Add the following directive to your Javascript manifest file (application.js):

  //= require d3

## Versioning

This gem's version will continue to mirror the version of d3.js. Should a gem bug be discovered, a 4th version identifier will be added and incremented.
